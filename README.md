# ICC-World-T20-2024-Player-Analysis

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of player performances in the ICC World T20 2024. Using Power BI, I have created an interactive dashboard that categorizes players into various roles such as Power Hitters, Anchors, Finishers, All-rounders, and Specialist Fast Bowlers. The aim is to evaluate players based on key performance metrics and select the optimal Final 11 for a winning team.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to utilize data-driven insights to enhance decision-making in team selection for the ICC World T20 2024. By analyzing performance metrics like Strike Rate, Batting Average, and Boundary Percentage, the project aims to:
- Identify top performers in each player category.
- Select the best possible Final 11 players for a balanced and competitive team.
- Provide a visual and analytical approach to cricket team management.

## How to View the Dashboard
- The Power BI dashboard is available as a PowerPoint presentation in this repository.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how data analysis can be applied in the sports industry, specifically in cricket, to make informed decisions regarding team selection. The Power BI dashboard not only provides an in-depth look at player performance but also aids in creating a balanced and strategic Final 11. The insights derived from this analysis can significantly contribute to achieving success in the ICC World T20 2024.
